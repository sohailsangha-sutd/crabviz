# Crabviz

Crabviz is a [LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)-based call graph generator. It leverages the Language Server Protocol to generate interactive call graphs, helps you visually explore source code.

## Features

* Workable for various programming languages
* Highlight on click
* Two kinds of graphs

   You can generate a call graph for selected files to get an overview, or a selected function to track the call hierarchy.
* Export call graphs as SVG

## Requirements

Since Crabviz utilizes the capabilities of language servers under the hood, if you want to analyze source code with it, you should have corresponding language extensions installed.

## Usage

* Generate a call graph for selected files and folders
